Package smp implements the solution to the &#34;Stable Roommates Problem&#34;.
</p>
<p>
It implements the Irving (1985) algorithm, which calculates a stable match
within an even-sized set given each member&#39;s preference of the other members.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</h3>
<p>
See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem</a>
</p>
<p>
The algorithm runs in 3 phases.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Phase_1">Phase 1</h3>
<p>
In this round each member who has not had their proposal accepted &#34;proposes&#34;
to their top remaining preference
</p>
<p>
Each recipient of a proposal can take one of 3 actions -
</p>
<p>
1. The recipient has not received a previous proposal and immediately accepts
</p>
<p>
2. The recipient prefers this new proposal over an existing one.
The recipient &#34;rejects&#34; it&#39;s initial proposl and accepts this new one
</p>
<p>
3. The recipient prefers the existing proposal over the new one.
The recipient &#34;rejects&#34; the new proposal
</p>
<p>
In the above situations, every rejection is mutual - if `i` removes `j` from
its preference list, then `j` must also remove `i` from its list
</p>
<p>
This cycle continues until one of two things happens:
</p>
<p>
A. Every member has had their proposal accepted (Move on to Phase 2)
</p>
<p>
B. At least one member has exhausted their preference list (No solution exists)
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Phase_2">Phase 2</h3>
<p>
In this phase, each member that has accepted a proposal will remove those they
prefer less than their current proposer.
</p>
<p>
At the end of one iteration, one of 3 states are possible -
</p>
<p>
A. At least one member has exhausted their preference list (No solution exists)
</p>
<p>
B. Some members have multiple preferences remaining (Proceed to Phase 3)
</p>
<p>
C. All members have one preference remaining (Solution has been found, no need
to run Phase 3)
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Phase_3">Phase 3</h3>
<p>
In this last phase we attempt to find any preference cycles and reject them.
</p>
<p>
This is done by building a pair of members (Xi, Yi) as follows
</p>
<pre>* Xi is the first member with at least 2 preferences
* Yi is null
* Yi+1 is the 2nd preference of Xi
* Xi+1 is the last preference of Yi+1
</pre>
<p>
Continue calculating pairs (Xi, Yi) until Xi repeats values. At this point a
cycle has been found.
</p>
<p>
We then mutually reject every pair (Xi, Yi)
</p>
<p>
After this one of 3 possiblities exists -
</p>
<p>
A. At least one member has exhausted their preference list (No solution exists)
</p>
<p>
B. Some members have multiple preferences remaining (Repeat the above process to
eliminate further cycles)
</p>
<p>
C. All members have one preference remaining (Solution has been found)
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-STABILITY_AND_DETERMINISM">STABILITY AND DETERMINISM</h3>
<p>
A stable solution is NOT guranteed. If no further possible proposal exists in
Phase 1 or the reduced preference table results in an empty list in Phase 3,
then no stable solution will exist.
</p>
<p>
However, if a solution does exist it is guranteed to be deterministic. That is,
a solution will always converge on one and only one optimial mapping between
members.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-ALGORITHM_EXAMPLE">ALGORITHM EXAMPLE</h3>
<p>
See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lo7TFAkohE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lo7TFAkohE</a>
</p>
<p>
Take the following preference table
</p>
<pre>A =&gt; [B, D, F, C, E]
B =&gt; [D, E, F, A, C]
C =&gt; [D, E, F, A, B]
D =&gt; [F, C, A, E, B]
E =&gt; [F, C, D, B, A]
F =&gt; [A, B, D, C, E]
</pre>
<p>
We always start with the first unmatched user. Initially this is &#34;A&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The sequence of events are -
</p>
<pre>&#39;A&#39; proposes to &#39;B&#39;
&#39;B&#39; accepts &#39;A&#39;
&#39;B&#39; proposes to &#39;D&#39;
&#39;D&#39; accepts &#39;B&#39;
&#39;C&#39; proposes to &#39;D&#39;
&#39;D&#39; accepts &#39;C&#39;, rejects &#39;B&#39;
&#39;B&#39; proposes to &#39;E&#39;
&#39;E&#39; accepts &#39;B&#39;
&#39;D&#39; proposes to &#39;F&#39;
&#39;F&#39; accepts &#39;D&#39;
&#39;E&#39; proposes to &#39;F&#39;
&#39;F&#39; rejects
&#39;E&#39; proposes to &#39;C&#39;
&#39;C&#39; accepts &#39;E&#39;
&#39;F&#39; proposes to &#39;A&#39;
&#39;A&#39; accepts &#39;F&#39;
</pre>
<p>
The result of Phase 1 is shown below. A &#34;-&#34; indicates a proposal made and a &#34;+&#34;
indicates a proposal accepted. Rejected members are removed.
</p>
<pre>A =&gt; [-B, D, +F, C, E]
B =&gt; [-E, F, +A, C]
C =&gt; [-D, +E, F, A,B]
D =&gt; [-F, +C, A, E]
E =&gt; [-C, D, +B, A]
F =&gt; [-A, B, +D, C]
</pre>
<p>
Phase 2 rejects occur as follows. Note that all rejections are
mutual - if `i` removes `j` from its preference list, then `j` must also
remove `i` from its list
</p>
<pre>&#39;A&#39; accepted by &#39;B&#39;. &#39;B&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;A&#39;: [&#34;C&#34;]
&#39;B&#39; accepted by &#39;E&#39;. &#39;E&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;B&#39;: [&#34;A&#34;]
&#39;C&#39; accepted by &#39;D&#39;. &#39;D&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;C&#39;: [&#34;A&#34;, &#34;E&#34;]
&#39;D&#39; accepted by &#39;F&#39;. &#39;F&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;D&#39;: [&#34;C&#34;]
&#39;E&#39; accepted by &#39;C&#39;. &#39;C&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;E&#39;: [&#34;A&#34;]
&#39;F&#39; accepted by &#39;A&#39;. &#39;A&#39; rejecting members less preferred than &#39;F&#39;: []
</pre>
<p>
The output of this phase is a further reduced table is as follows
</p>
<pre>A =&gt; [B, F]
B =&gt; [E, F, A]
C =&gt; [D, E]
D =&gt; [F, C]
E =&gt; [C, B],
F =&gt; [A, B, D]
</pre>
<p>
Since at least one member has multiple preferences remaining, we proceed to
Phase 3.
</p>
<p>
Phase 3 starts with &#34;A&#34; since it is the first member with at least two
preferences.
</p>
<p>
Build (Xi, Yi) pairs as follows
</p>
<pre>i      1   2   3   4
-----+---+---+---+----
x:   | A | D | E | A
y:   | - | F | C | B
</pre>
<p>
Where -
</p>
<pre>&#39;F&#39; is the 2nd preference of &#39;A&#39;
&#39;D&#39; is the last preference of &#39;F&#39;
&#39;C&#39; is the 2nd preference of &#39;D&#39;
etc...
</pre>
<p>
As soon as we see &#34;A&#34; again, we stop since we have found a cycle.
</p>
<p>
Now we will mutually reject the following pairs, as definied by the inner
pairings
</p>
<pre>(D, F)
(E, C)
(A, B)
</pre>
<p>
At this point, no preference list is exhausted and some have more than one
preference remaining. We need to find and eliminate more preference cycles.
</p>
<pre>i      1   2
-----+---+---
x:   | B | B
y:   | - | F
</pre>
<p>
Now we will mutually reject
</p>
<pre>(F, B)
</pre>
<p>
This gives us the stable solution below, since each roommate has exactly one
preference remaining
</p>
<pre>A =&gt; F
B =&gt; E
C =&gt; D
D =&gt; C
E =&gt; B
F =&gt; A
</pre>
